# Evolution of the C++ Programming Language

## Introduction

<img align="right" src="images/stroustrup.jpg" alt="Bjarne Stroustrup Headshot"/> The C++ language begins with Bjarne Stroustrup. In 1979, he worked with the _Simula_ language for his Ph.D. thesis. The particular varaint of _Simula_ that he worked with was _Simula 67_ which is know to be the first language to support the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. This paradigm inspired him to begin work on a language that took everything about the C language and then add classes to the language [1]. It was called, creatively, _C with Classes_ and had 3 goals: 

1. It should be organized with classes and inheritance.
2. It will have little to no performance hit relative to the _C_ language.
3. That it could be used for any application that _C_ could be used (yes even the bad stuff) [2].

In 1983, the _C with Classes_ name was officially changed to _C++_, but it wasn't until 1985, that the first implementation and compiler were released [2]. The compiler, called Cfont, was actually written in _C with Classes_ and additionally translated the compiled _C with Classes_ programs into standard _C_ code [1].

The language did not yet have a formal standardization, but two references were published to aid programmers in its use. _The C++ Programming Language_ in 1985, followed by the _The Annotated C++ Reference Manual_ in 1990. Both of these references influenced the first international standard for C++: ISO/IEC 14882:1998 that arrived in 1998 (informally C++98).[1]

This language took the imperative _C_ language and added classes to it to provide better organization and powerful OOP concepts that continued to evolve.


## Evolution and Continued Use

The development of C started out when Bjarne Stroustrup had problems dealing with complicated code. The program had only class features and his goal wasto add object oriented programming in C language in 1979. Language name was changed from C to C++. Bjarne Stroustrup added new features which included references, virtual functions, constants, type-safe freestore memory allocation, and single line comments with two forward slashes in 1983. 

First edition of C++ programming was released in 1985. Between 1990 and 2010 bugs and glitches were fixed and versions of C++ were updating. The versionlabel name started out as C++98 and was finally updated to C++11. Between 2011 and 2019 new features were added such as lambda expressions, polymorphic lambas, delegating constructors, uniform initialization syntax, hexadecimal floating point literals, type deduction and decltype, and more. The latest version of C++ was finalized in February 2020 and approved in September 2020. The latest version of C++ was expected to released in 2021. C++ is still being used to this day and will continue to be used in the future.

## Conclusion

C++ is showing strong signs of remaining a top choice language for the medium to longterm future, especially for applications that prioritize quick executing and
low latency code (such as games and server software). The ISO task force that publishes C++ language specifications recently approved a C++20 standard and is
already working on the next version, C++23.  Because of the large body of existing code and the prevalence of skilled programmers throughout the software engineering
workforce, C++ should continue to be a preferred choice for mainstream applications for years to come.
